Basic mathematica notebooks for quantum gases

These are mathematica notebooks from 2023 relating to basic calculations for superfluid quantum gases. Each notebook contains more information on how to use it, and references to the papers that contain the description of the theory.

GrossPitaevskiiSolver.nb  is a split-step solver for the 1D Gross Pitaevskii equation, the workhorse formalism to model a Bose-Einstein condensate. 

TruncatedWignerApproximation.bb  is used to include quantum fluctuations on top of the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii equation, based on the Truncated Wigner formalism.

Saddlepointsolutions.nb   implements the saddle point equation of state for superfluid Fermi gases.
